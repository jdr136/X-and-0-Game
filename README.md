# X-and-0-Game
Repo for very basic command line X and 0 Game. 
Built as a 1 day project when returning to python coding. 
Currently consists of 1 and 2 player options with basic error handeling. Bot is completely random. 
Future iterations may include levels of bot intelligence, score board and GUI interface.
